# EmployeeDatabase
Employee Database using binary search tree

Data about current employees should be on the file "Employee.txt". You will need to create your own employee file and submit it with the final project.

Each employee should have the following attributes:

Employee_Number       -                      Integer

Employee_Last_Name     -                     String

Employee_First_Name     -                    String

Employee_Years_of_Service-              Integer


3 employees must be loaded from the Employee.txt file on program start up.

Functionality:

Command-Processing

ADD-Allows the user to “Add” an employee to the tree

REMOVE-Allows the user to “Remove” an employee from the tree

COUNT-Returns the number of Employees in the tree

PRINT-Prints the employee information in the list to the console

Clone this repository, Add your Initial Attributes to the 'Employee.txt' file and then Run the 'main.cpp' file.
